Bank Management System

*Project Title:* Bank Management System  
*Language:* C++  
*Platform:* Console Application  

Description

This is a *Bank Management System* developed using *C++* as a console application based on *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* principles.
The system allows an admin to manage users and clients efficiently, providing features to add, update, delete, and search for users and clients.
It also facilitates managing client transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts. 
The project is designed using *Class Libraries* to link different parts of the system, ensuring a flexible and scalable structure.

The system uses *file management* to store data permanently,
ensuring user and transaction data is preserved across sessions.

Technologies Used

- *C++*: The main language used for the development of the entire application.
- *File Management*: Data is stored and managed using file operations in C++.
- *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*: Using classes (Classes) to organize the code and link various parts of the application together.
- *Class Libraries*: Using class libraries to link different interfaces within the system in a flexible way.
- *Console Application*: A simple text-based interface that interacts with users through command line input.
